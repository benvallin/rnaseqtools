\title{Search genes in leading edges}
\usage{
search_genes_in_leading_edges(input, gene_ids, group_name = "searched")
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{data.frame or tibble with leadingEdge list-column and n_leadingEdge column, as produced by rnaseqtools::multi_fgsea.}

\item{gene_ids}{character vector of gene IDs to search in leading edges. Must be the same type of gene IDs as in the leadingEdge list-column.}

\item{group_name}{character vector of length 1 representing group name for the searched genes.}
}
\value{
the input table augmented with gene search results.
}

# Get leading edge for KEGG_RIBOSOME gene set

                          set_name = "KEGG_RIBOSOME")

# Search genes representing KEGG_RIBOSOME leading edge in all leading edges
